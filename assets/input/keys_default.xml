        This mapping set serves only one need: to disable all mappings
        hard-coded into jME to avoid double mappings and to restore them
        on interest. Therefore this mapping set should cover all mappings
        found in jME classes and only them. Other mapping sets may (and should)
        go beyond this limit but not this one!
